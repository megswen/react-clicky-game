## How to Play
The idea of the game is to click each Freaks & Geeks character once and only once. For every unique click, you get one point, with a possible twelve points to accumulate. If you click a character twice, the game resets your score to zero, and if your final score is higher than the current top score, your final score will replace the new top score.
